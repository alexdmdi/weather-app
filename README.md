This is a react-vite typescript project that fetches weather data from a free API (https://OpenWeatherMap.org). By default the page gets the users location to set the weather and forecast data, by fetching approximate coordinates from ipapi (https://ipapi.co/json).

No data is retained, this project does not use a back end or database. 
No data fetched from ipapi is used besides the approximate coordinates.
