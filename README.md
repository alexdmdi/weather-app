## About 
* This is a React-Vite Typescript project that fetches weather data from [OpenWeather](https://OpenWeatherMap.org). 
* By default, the page sets the location to the nearest locale based on the users approximate coordinates, which are fetched from ipapi (https://ipapi.co/json). If you are using a VPN or are on roaming data from a different location, it will not accurately detect your current location. <br>
* The styling changes based on the location and whether or not the sun is up there. <br> <br>


## Development
* React (vite, typescript) <br>
* Customized Bootstrap components and some plain CSS <br>
* NPM: date-and-time, gh-pages

## Data & Privacy
* No data on my side as the developer is retained, I did not implement a back end or database <br>
* ipapi only runs on the client side device, for the purpose of setting the default location
