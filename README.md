## About 
This is a react-vite typescript project that fetches weather data from a free API (https://OpenWeatherMap.org). By default the page sets the location
to the nearest locale based on the users approximate coordinates, which are fetched from ipapi (https://ipapi.co/json). Units are in celcius. 
The page theme changes based on the set location and whether or not it is day time there, based on sunset and sunrise.

## Built With
-React (vite, typescript)
-Bootstrap/CSS
-Node packages/modules: date-and-time, gh-pages

## Data
No data is retained, there is no back end or database. 
No data besides approximate coordinates is utilized from the ipapi json response
