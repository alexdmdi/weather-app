## About 
-This is a react-vite typescript project that fetches weather data from a free API (https://OpenWeatherMap.org). By default the page sets the location
to the nearest locale based on the users approximate coordinates, which are fetched from ipapi (https://ipapi.co/json). If you are using a VPN or are
on roaming data from a different location, it will not accurately detect your current location. <br>

-The styling changes based on the location and whether or not the sun is up there. <br> <br>


## Built With
-React (vite, typescript) <br>
-Bootstrap/CSS <br>
-Node packages/modules: date-and-time, gh-pages

## Data
No data is retained, there is no back end or database. <br>
No data besides approximate coordinates is utilized from the ipapi json response
